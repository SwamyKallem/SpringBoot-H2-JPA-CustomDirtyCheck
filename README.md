Introduction:

Hibernate’s dirty checking mechanism is a cornerstone for persistence operations, ensuring only modified entities are updated in the database. However, the default behaviour might not always align perfectly with your domain model. This blog post introduces a custom @IgnoreDirtyProperty annotation to selectively exclude properties from dirty checking, enhancing efficiency and flexibility.

Understanding Dirty Checking:

When an entity is retrieved from the database and later persisted, Hibernate compares its current state with the original state. Properties with changes are flagged as “dirty,” and only those dirty properties are written to the database during the update operation. This approach optimizes database interactions but can become cumbersome in specific scenarios.

Challenges with Default Dirty Checking:

Transient Properties: Some properties might be used temporarily within your application logic but don’t require persistence. Including them in dirty checking can lead to unnecessary overhead.
Calculated Fields: Properties derived from other properties don’t necessarily need to be tracked for changes.
Versioning Fields: Versioning columns often get incremented automatically and shouldn’t trigger updates.
Introducing @IgnoreDirtyProperty:

To address these challenges, we can create a custom annotation:

Java

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.FIELD)
public @interface IgnoreDirtyProperty {
}
Use code https://github.com/SwamyKallem/SpringBoot-H2-JPA-CustomDirtyCheck


This annotation can be applied to entity properties to signal Hibernate to exclude them from dirty checking.

Implementation:

Here’s how to leverage the @IgnoreDirtyProperty annotation:

Java

public class MyEntity {
 @Id
  private Long id;
private String name;
  @IgnoreDirtyProperty
  private String tempData;
  // Getters and setters omitted for brevity
}

In this example, the tempData property is marked with @IgnoreDirtyProperty. Any changes to tempData won't be considered during the update process.

Benefits of Custom Dirty Checking:

Improved Performance: By excluding unnecessary properties, you can potentially reduce the number of database writes and enhance application responsiveness.
Cleaner Code: The annotation provides a clear and concise way to manage dirty checking behavior within your domain model.
Flexibility: You can tailor dirty checking to your specific data model requirements.
